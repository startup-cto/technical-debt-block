# GitHub Blocks Template

Use this repository as a starter template for building your own Blocks.
## Quickstart

> 🛑 Currently, you must be flagged into the [GitHub Blocks Technical Preview](https://blocks.githubnext.com) in order to develop blocks. There is no "offline" development mode at this time.

Fork this repo using the [`Use this template`](https://github.com/githubnext/blocks-template/generate) button above:

!["Use this template" button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8978670/144893319-5d45ab5c-12c0-42b4-99f8-97f658deb03b.png)

Then, clone _your_ repo (not [this one!](https://github.com/githubnext/blocks-template)) and get ready for action:

```bash
yarn # install dependencies
yarn start # start the dev server
# Or use npm, pnpm, you know the drill
```

When you visit [localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000) in your browser, you'll be
redirected to the Blocks app, but your locally-developed blocks will appear in the block picker:

(if you're using Safari (or another browser that doesn't permit calling `http` URLs from an `https` page), run `yarn start-https` and visit [https://localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000) instead.)

This template includes one example File Block and one Folder Block. The dev server supports hot reloading, so make some changes, and see what they do!

## Under the hood

Currently, Blocks are [React](https://reactjs.org/) components. They have a well-defined contract with their surroundings, and receive a [fixed set of props](https://github.com/githubnext/blocks/blob/main/docs/Developing%20blocks/4%20API%20reference%20and%20types.md) when they are instantiated. They are developed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and bundled with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
